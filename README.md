# Thesis

(Work in progress) This repository contains:

1) An implementation of the construction of the direct product of two directed labelled multigraphs, as presented in "The complexity of reverse engineering problems for conjunctive queries" (by Barcel√≥ and Romero, 2016).

2) An implementatio of a 'brute force' algorithm to check for the existence of an homomorphism between the direct product construction and the negative examples, plus a check of the 'safety' property.
